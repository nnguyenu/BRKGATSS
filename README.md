# Paper summarize
1. Introduction
- Target Set Selection (TSS) problem is about reaching the largest amount of potential consumers while, at the same time, minimizing the amount of allocated resources
- In particular, the TSS problem is a combinato- rial optimization problem based on different diffusion models in graph ???
- 2 variants of the TSS problem:

    1. K-max / influence maximization: Finding the subset of $k$ users in the social network such that their combined influence can reach the maximum number of users in the whole network
    2. J-MIN: find the minimum set of users in a given social network such that they can influence the whole network
- In this paper, we consider the latter problem variant.
